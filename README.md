[Finished Project and code that was written](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-challenge-todo-list-database-stats/4833819632123904)

**STEP ONE Insert another item to your todo list with the estimated minutes. this is what I added**
SELECT INTO todo_list VALUES (4, "Make some food", 30);

**STEP TWO now it wants me to select the sum of all the mintues. this is what I wrote**
SELECT SUM(minutes) FROM todo_list;
